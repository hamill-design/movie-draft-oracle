# Implementation Plan - Guest Session Support

## Phase 1: Database Foundation âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create `guest_sessions` table
- [x] Add `guest_session_id` to `drafts` table
- [x] Add `guest_participant_id` to `draft_participants` table
- [x] Create helper functions (`current_guest_session`, `migrate_guest_drafts_to_user`)
- [x] Update all RLS policies for dual access (user_id OR guest_session_id)
- [x] Create cleanup function for expired sessions

## Phase 2: Frontend Authentication System (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Create `useGuestSession` hook for guest session management
- [x] Update `AuthContext` to support both user and guest sessions
- [x] Create `SaveDraftPrompt` component for account creation prompts
- [ ] Update `useDraftOperations` to handle guest sessions
- [ ] Update `useMultiplayerDraft` to support guest participants

## Phase 3: Component Updates
### Core Components
