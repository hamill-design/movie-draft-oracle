# Frameworks & Implementation

## Architecture Pattern
**Atomic Design + Feature-Based Organization**

## React Patterns
- Props down, events up
- Context for global state
- Custom hooks for logic
- Memoization for performance

## Styling Implementation
- Utility-first with semantic tokens
- Component variants using class-variance-authority
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## State Management
- Local state: useState/useReducer
- Global state: React Context
- Server state: React Query pattern

## Performance Optimization
- Component memoization
- Code splitting
- Bundle optimization
- Efficient re-renders
